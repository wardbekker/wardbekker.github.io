Hi there! I am a technical lead and product owner with over 14 years experience in web- and mobile application development.

I believe in people over process. Agile methodologies like Scrum are not silver bullets, they are amplifiers. If you don’t have a gelled team in the first place, an Agile process is not going magically fix your quality and productivity problems. But a gelled Agile team can continuously deliver above expectations.

I also think you should use the right tool for the job. Don’t just blindly apply what’s familiar to you or trendy. Like the saying goes: ‘If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail’. That’s why I consider myself a polyglot developer. I’m eager to learn new languages, frameworks and technology concepts and apply those which match the requirements of the project best.

As a programmer you are not building ‘just’ software, you are building products that should delight users. That’s why I like to mix up my technical lead role with a product ownership role. Understanding user needs and having a clear product vision is key for a good design and prioritisation of the work.
