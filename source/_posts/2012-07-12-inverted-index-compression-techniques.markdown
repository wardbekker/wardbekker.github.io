Today I presented at at the Dutch Erlang Usergroup meeting, hosted by [Spilgames](http://www.spilgames.com/).

In this presentation I explained:

- How to build a inverted index that supports boolean AND queries
- Elias Æ” (gamma) encoding and Delta gap compression to reduce the size of inverted indexes
