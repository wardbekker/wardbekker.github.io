2014 just started and is already a great year for high pixel density lovers. Three affordable 4K desktop monitors where introduced at CES 2014. Release is expected to be in Q1 & Q2 of this year. 

The 4k monitors:

- [28" 3840x2160 Dell P2815Q](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2014/01/07/dell-wasnt-joking-about-that-28-inch-sub-1000-4k-monitor-its-only-699/) - Available January 2014 - *699 USD*
- [28" 3840x2160 Lenovo ThinkVision Pro2840m](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7635/lenovo-at-ces-2014-thinkvision-pro2830m-28-inch-4k-professional-display) - Available April 2014 - *799 USD*
- [28" 3840x2160 Asus PB287Q](http://www.engadget.com/2014/01/06/asus-28-inch-4k-display/) - Available Q2 2014 - *799 USD*

Your laptop or PC probably needs to support *DisplayPort 1.2* to take advantage of the high resolution. My work supplied Mid-2009 Macbook Pro certainly doesn't. Time for an upgrade!
