Intro:

31575 calories. That's 83 liters of coca cola, or 8 kg of sugar. 

343 KM or 213 mi with runkeeper on a 5S
For running use only.
Didn't connect with HR monitor.
For weight loss first. lost about 14Kilo (from 98KG to 84KG). Run my first 10K, ran and now less focused on weight loss, and now training for a sub 1:45 HM in 21 september. Fingers crossed.
I generally run by myself.
What's runkeeper


Screenshots:

- Running records
- Configurable audio cues
- Limited custom training options


Things I like:

Audio Cues: must have feature and very configurable

During running, Your phone is probably stowed away in an arband.  It's not as easy to look at and control your phone. Making it difficult.. That's why Runkeeper has audio cues. A woman voice will give you useful data like your overall time and distance, average pace & speed, current pace & speed and split pace & speed. The audio cues are very configurable. During training I like to get an update every 5 minutes, with my overall time and distance, and my current and my split pace. During the audio cue any music will be slitly muted, so you can hear it probably.  On my previous (and first ever) race, I set it to 2 minutes, so I'm sure I stick to my pace.

Personal records are great motivators.

As I just started running, and you make a lot of progress, Runkeeper will show me almost on every run something to celebrate or motivate me. Things like distance, calories burned, split places, avarage speed. [screenshot here]. 

Sharing with Facebook and Twitter of great runs.


Great that your activities are visible on their website.
Doesn't crash during running. I did have that problem on my iPhone4, but that hardware is ancient.

Free plan offers a lot of value, even for heavy users.


Things that can be improved:

Limited custom training options, my workaround is not to track the whole training, but only the important parts. 
Audio cues timings are off
Elite upgrade price per month high and for me didn't add that much value.
Warmup duration cannot be changed. 5 minutes is not sufficient.

Things I didn't use yet:

Adding routes. During my warmup I generally decide on a direction. I do look at google Maps for inspiration. 
Adding music.
Friends. 
Broadcasting my run to friends.
